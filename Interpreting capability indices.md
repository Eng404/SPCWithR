Interpreting capability indices 
====================================
In the calculation of process capability indices so far, we have derived the 
standard deviation, Ïƒ, and recognized that this estimates the short-term 
variations within the process. This short term is the period over which the 
process remains relatively stable, but we know that processes do not 
remain stable for all time and so we need to allow within the specified 
tolerance limits for: 
 
-some movement of the mean; 
- the detection of changes of the mean; 
- possible changes in the scatter (range); 
- the detection of changes in the scatter; 
- the possible complications of non-normal distributions. 
 
Taking these into account, the following values of the Cpk index 
represent the given level of confidence in the process capability: 

Case 1 Index < 1
A situation in which the production system is not capable 
and there will inevitably be non-conforming output from the 
process. 

Case 2 Index = 1
A situation in which the production system is not really 
capable, since any change within the process will result in some 
undetected non-conforming output. 

Case 3 Index =1.33
A situation in which the production system is not really 
capable, since any change within the process will result in some 
undetected non-conforming output. 

Case 4 Index = 2
High level of confidence in the production system, 
provided that control charts are in regular use.
