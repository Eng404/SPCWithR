\section{ACCEPTANCE SAMPLING}

Acceptance Sampling is a statistical measure used in quality control. A company cannot test every one of its products due to either ruining the products, or the volume of products being too large.

Acceptance sampling solves this by testing a sample of product for defects. The process involves batch size, sample size and the number of defects acceptable in the batch. This process allows a company to measure the quality of a batch with a specified degree of statistical certainty without having to test every unit of product. The statistical reliability of a sample is generally measured by a t-statistic.
