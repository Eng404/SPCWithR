Cumulative flow diagram
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

QueueingIO
A cumulative flow diagram is a tool used in queuing theory. It is an area graph that depicts the quantity of work in a given state, showing arrivals, time in queue, quantity in queue, and departure.

Cumulative flow diagrams are seen in the literature of agile software development and lean product development.[1][2] They are also seen in transportation.[3]

Another term is "cumulative input-output diagram". The term "Newell curve" is also used, in reference to Gordon F. Newell. It is not known if Newell originated the curve.
